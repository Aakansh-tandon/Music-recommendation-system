# Music-recommendation-system

This project is a Music Recommendation System that utilizes content-based filtering to suggest songs similar to a userâ€™s preferences. The system analyzes the attributes of each song to find ones with similar characteristics, providing a personalized and engaging music experience.

Project Overview
With the massive amount of music available online, finding the right songs can be overwhelming. Our recommendation system aims to simplify this process by using content-based filtering to recommend songs based on the features of the songs a user already enjoys.

This project involves:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Extracting audio features like tempo, danceability, energy, etc., to represent each song.
Content-Based Filtering: Calculating song similarity and recommending songs based on content similarity.
Model Testing: Evaluating the recommendation quality based on user inputs.
Features
Provides personalized song recommendations based on audio features.
Uses content-based filtering, focusing on the attributes of each song.
Enables users to explore a curated list of songs similar to their preferences.
Dataset
We use the Spotify Million Song Dataset from Kaggle, which provides detailed information on audio features for each track. This rich dataset helps in building accurate and relevant recommendations.

Technologies Used
Python for data processing and machine learning.
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn for implementing content-based filtering.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
How It Works
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes cleaning and feature selection to ensure high-quality inputs.
Content-Based Filtering: By analyzing features such as tempo, energy, danceability, etc., we compute the similarity between songs.
Recommendation Generation: Based on a user's input song(s), the system recommends other songs with similar features.
Data Visualization and EDA
To understand the dataset better, we perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize song attributes, identify patterns, and refine our recommendations.
